infixparser.java
----------------
This program converts infix mathematical expressions to their postfix representaion.

Example:
	Infix expression: 2 + 3 * (3 - 1)
        Postfix expression: 2 3 3 1 - * + = 8

- Accepts filename of a file in the current directory with infix expressions (optional), 
	If no arg is given, it will look for the file named "input.infix".

- Returns expressions in their postfix form, along with their output.

Utlilizes:
	Token.java - provides abstract class for tokens
	Operand.java - provides class for operands, extends Token class
	Operator.java - provides class for operators, extends Token class
	opType.java - provides class for operation types, including +, -, *, /, %. 

input.infix
-----------
Sample file that tests infixparser.java.
Contains infix mathematical expressions, each separated by a new line.

build.xml
---------
Target descriptions:
Compile - compiles all the Java files in the current directory. 
Run - runs infixparser with arg value "input.infix". input.infix should be in the current working directory.
Clean - removes all the .class files.
Doc - runs Javadoc on infixparser to generate documentation.

Generated Documentation
-----------------------
Found in the folder /doc.
Can be generated by running the command "ant doc", and will produce documentation for infixparser.java.
Documenation discusses the methods of infixparser, as well as their inputs and outputs.
To view the Javadoc, use the command "firefox index.html" while in the doc folder.
