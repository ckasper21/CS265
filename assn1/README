README for assignment 1

BEFORE RUNNING ANY SCRIPTS
--------------------------
Set a shell variable ARCHIVE to the path to the directory of threads
Export it. This will allow for it to be used in the scripts.

i.e 
ARCHIVE=/home/cdc75/CS265/Git/assn1/DrMath/Archive
export ARCHIVE

prob1
-----
Outputs two columns: # of directories (threads) , total amount of messages

prob2
-----
Outputs two columns: name of thread (directory), with total messages in that thread.
NOTE: Only threads with the most messages will be shown (multiple threads can have 
the same amount of messages)

prob3
-----
Script has three inputs: year , month, day
Example: ./prob3 1995 10 21

Outputs a list of messages that were sent on that day

Creates one log file during runtime
-prob3.log ($ARCHIVE/prob3.log)
	contains output for prob3, list of messages sent on the specific day

Log file is deleted at the end of the script

prob4
-----
Outputs two columns: hostname, number of messages sent to them
Also outputs the total count of hostnames 

Creates three log files during runtime
-hostnames.log ($ARCHIVE/hostnames.log)
	contains the hostnames from every message
-uniqhostnames.log ($ARCHIVE/uniqhostnames.log)
	contains distinct hostnames from hostnames.log (accounts for dups)
-prob4.log ($ARCHIVE/prob4.log)
	contains output for prob4, hostnames in one col, with number of messages sent to them in another

 
Log files are deleted at the end of the script


TESTING NOTES:
--------------
- Took a subset of the archive threads from Prof. Schmidt's directory
- Created empty directories to test directory checks (See comments in code)
- Created threads with the same amount of messages to check prob2
- Created messages with the same sent date to check prob3
- Created messages with the same hostnames but in different format to test prob4
	Example (when hostnames in messages are): chriskasper , Chriskasper , CHrisKasper 
	Outputs: chriskasper 3
